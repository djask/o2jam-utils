# o2jam_converter

Just a couple of utilities designed to make working with o2jam files easier. Currently an implementation for dumping ojm files (as per the ojm documentation on the open2jam blogspot) and also some work on ojn headers. 

This currently has working osz conversion for OGG only o2jam files (which is most of the files anyways). There currently isn't an interface for this, so you'll have to put your conversion directory manually in the debug file.
