# o2jam_converter

Just a couple of utilities designed to make working with o2jam files easier. Currently an implementation for dumping ojm files (as per the ojm documentation on the open2jam blogspot) and also some work on ojn headers. 

Eventually I'd like this to convert files to play on other games like osu or bms.
